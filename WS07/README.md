# Workshop 7: STL Algorithms
In this workshop, you use the Algorithm category of the Standard Template Library.

You are going to create an application that manages a collection of songs.


## Learning
- copy data from a file into a sequential container
- use the numeric library to accumulate data values
- use a lambda expression to specify an operation on each value in a data set
- use the algorithm library to sort data valuesAlgorithms
