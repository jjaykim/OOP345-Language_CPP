# Week 2 Workshop : Move and Copy Semantics
In this workshop, you work with a large dynamically allocated array of C++ Standard Library strings and compare the performance of copy and move operations on that collection.

## Learning
- retrieve records from a text file using an input file stream object
- count the number of records in a text file
- monitor the time spent on a particular task using the std::chrono library
- implement copy semantics for a class with a resource
- implement move semantics for a class with a resource
- identify the processing-intensive operations in copy and move assignments
