# Week 1 Workshop : Across Translation Units
In this workshop, I implemented aspects of linkage, storage duration, namespaces, header guards, and operating system interfaces.

## Learning
- receive program arguments from the command line
- guard a class definition from duplication in a translation unit
- access a variable defined in a different translation unit
- declare a local variable that resides in memory throughout the lifetime of the program
- upgrade code to accept and manage a user-defined string of any length
