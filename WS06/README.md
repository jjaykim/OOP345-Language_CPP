# Workshop 6: STL Containers
In this workshop, you store polymorphic objects in an STL container.

You are going to create an application that simulates an autoshop that sells various types of vehicles. This specific application, will focus on cars and racecars.


## Learning
- manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL
- move a dynamically allocated object into a container
- code a range-based iteration on the objects in a container
- report and handle an exception
